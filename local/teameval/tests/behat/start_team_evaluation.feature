    @javascript
    Scenario: Team submission assignment allows local_teameval
        Given I log in as "teacher1"
        And I follow "Course 1"
        And I turn editing mode on
        And I add a "Assignment" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
            | name | Test teameval assignment |
            | Description | This assignment should allow team evaluation |
            | assignsubmission_onlinetext_enabled | 1 |
            | assignsubmission_file_enabled | 0 |
            | teamsubmission | Yes |
            | groupmode | Visible groups |
        
        When I follow "Test teameval assignment"
        And I wait until the page is ready

        Then I should see "Team evaluation" in the ".local-teameval-container-heading" "css_element"

        When I click on "Turn On Team Evaluation" "button"
        And I wait until the page is ready

        Then I should see "Team evaluation" in the ".local-teameval-container-heading" "css_element"
        And I should see "Settings" in the ".local-teameval-containerbox" "css_element"
        And I should see "Add Question" in the ".local-teameval-containerbox" "css_element"

    @javascript
    Scenario: Individual submission assignment does not allow local_teameval
        Given I log in as "teacher1"
        And I follow "Course 1"
        And I turn editing mode on
        And I add a "Assignment" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
            | name | Test teameval assignment |
            | Description | This assignment should not allow team evaluation |
            | assignsubmission_onlinetext_enabled | 1 |
            | assignsubmission_file_enabled | 0 |
            | teamsubmission | No |
            | groupmode | Visible groups |
        
        When I follow "Test teameval assignment"
        And I wait until the page is ready

        Then ".local-teameval-container-heading" "css_element" should not exist

    # TODO: Add workshep checks if installed. Not quite sure what the step is to skip if an activity doesn't exist.
